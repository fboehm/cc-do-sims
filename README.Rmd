## Goals

The goal of this project is to simulate traits and then map them in both CC and DO mice. In addition to comparing power to detect QTL in the two populations (CC and DO), we may also consider mapping strategies in which we first use CC mice and then map (over small regions) in DO mice. Other variations on this approach may be pursued.
